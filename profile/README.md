## Hi there 👋<br/>
<br/>
🙋‍♀️ *A short introduction* <br/>
We are the ZDoom team, a team of developers and contributors of many different skills and hobbies. We primarily develop and maintain the GZDoom and Raze source ports, and also some of the tools that can be used to fascilitate editing of game modifications which are supported by them.<br/>
<br/>
🌈 *Contribution guidelines* <br/>
Issues: We like issues to be separated into one-per-issue, not bulk issues. All bug reports, including crashes, should have some sort of easily reproducable content; this will make merges much easier.<br/>
<br/>
Pull Requests: The philosophy of our programming is a player/user-first model. We strongly disfavor any code that takes control away from the end-user for their gaming experience.<br/>
<br/>
Code Licensing: All contributors must allow their code to be licensed under BSD 3-clause for portability between projects, where possible. The GZDoom and Raze source ports are both GPL licensed, with Raze having additional Build license stipulations. Please refer to the documents contained within the projects for further information.<br/>

🍿 *Fun facts* <br/>
Thanks to Doom, demons die at a rate between hundreds to millions per second, depending on the time of day and the latest popular mapset to be released for it.<br/>
