### ðŸŒˆ Contribution guidelines
- Issues: We like issues to be separated into one-per-issue, not bulk issues. All bug reports, including crashes, should have some sort of easily reproducable content; this will make fixes much easier.

- Pull Requests: The philosophy of our programming is a player/user-first model. We strongly disfavor any code that takes control away from the end-user for their gaming experience.

- Code Licensing: All contributors must allow their code to be licensed under BSD 3-clause for portability between projects, where possible. The GZDoom and Raze source ports are both GPL licensed, with Raze having additional Build license stipulations. Please refer to the documents contained within the projects for further information.

- Art Licensing: Similar to code licensing, we require most art to follow a similar creative commons licensing scheme which allows portability and reuse. If it is a derived asset for it must go in the wadsrc_extra folder for GZDoom (or wadsrc for Raze) and must be licensed according to its original publisher license, and can only be used in the game from which it is derived.
